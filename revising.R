# This script analyzes whether litter size affects sociability by running a
# robust OP regression on the residuals of a trimmed means ANOVA with sex and 
# age as grouping factors in the C57BL/6J MICE, as described in Fairless et al 2012
# Fairless et al 2012, doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2011.12.001, PMID:  22178318, PMCID:  PMC3474345

# The fictional data in "altereddata.txt" were modified from the original 
# empirical data used in Fairless et al 2012.
# I am using fictional data instead of the original data because I do not have 
# permission of my co-authors to release the data into the public domain.  
# NOTE:  Because these data are fictional, several important characteristics of
# these data may be different from those of the original data.

# Each row is a separate mouse.
# The left-most 3 columns are quasi-independent variables (mouse strain, sex, and age).
# The right-most 5 columns are dependent variables describing behaviors of the
# mice during the Social Approach/Choice Test.

# analysis as described in Fairless et al 2012:
# "This result was confirmed by a simple OP regression of litter size and the
# residuals of a 2 Ã— 5 (sex by age) trimmed means ANOVA of social cylinder 
# investigation, which yielded a slope significantly less than zero, D = 0.004, 
# p < 0.001 (Fig. 3c)."
